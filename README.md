# South Bend temperature predictions
In this project. I Will use Linear regression model to analyze what environment factors are best to be used as predictors for temperature in South Bend area. <br />
Create a tool to predict the average temperature in the area using significant environment factors. <br />
The full analysis can be read in the [report file](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature/blob/master/final%20report%20temperature%20in%20South%20Bend.docx?raw=true)
