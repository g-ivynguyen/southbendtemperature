 
# South Bend temperature predictions
In this project. I Will use Linear regression model to analyze what environment factors are best to be used as predictors for temperature in South Bend area. <br />
Create a tool to predict the average temperature in the area using significant environment factors. Using this tool, one can predict the temperature in an area using:  albedo, fraction of low cloud, specific humidity, and incoming shortwaveflux. A prediction in South Bend temperature is featured below (MSE = 6.15). <br />

The full analysis can be read in the [report file](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature/blob/master/final%20report%20temperature%20in%20South%20Bend.docx?raw=true) <br />
The raw data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature/raw/master/South%20Bend%20temperature%20data.csv) <br />
For my code, you can download the [R file](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature/raw/master/final.Rmd) or the [html file](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature/raw/master/final.html) <br />
